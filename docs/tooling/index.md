## Code Generators

Intricate currently employs `3` code generators, namely:

- [**BindingsGenerator**](bindings-generator.md): Generates C++ to C# interop glue code (or bindings) during build-time
- **ImGuiCodeGenerator**: Generates C# binding wrappers around **cimgui** and **cimguizmo**
- **ResourceGenerator**: Expresses assets/resources as C++ and C# arrays which get compiled into the project
